=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library is a L<Net::HTTP::Spore>-based client for the message
queue component of OpenStack,
L<Zaqar|https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Marconi/specs/api/v1>
(previously known as "Marconi").

On top of allowing you to make requests to a Zaqar endpoint, this
library also supports Rackspace authentication using their L<Cloud
Identity|http://docs.rackspace.com/queues/api/v1.0/cq-gettingstarted/content/Generating_Auth_Token.html>
token system; see C<do_request>.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 base_url

(read-only string)

The base URL for all API queries, except for the Rackspace-specific
authentication.

=head2 client_uuid

(read-only string, defaults to a new UUID)

All API queries B<should> contain a "Client-ID" header (in practice,
some appear to work without this header).  If you do not provide a
value, a new one will be built with L<Data::UUID>.

The docs recommend reusing the same client UUID between restarts of
the client.

=head2 rackspace_api_key

(read-only optional string)

API key for Rackspace authentication endpoints.

=head2 rackspace_keystone_endpoint

(read-only optional string)

URL for Rackspace authentication endpoints.

=head2 rackspace_username

(read-only optional string)

Your Rackspace API username.

=head2 spore_client

(read-only object)

This is the L<Net::HTTP::Spore> client build with the
C<spore_description_file> attribute.  All API method calls will be
delegated to this object.

=head2 spore_description_file

(read-only required file path or URL)

Path to the SPORE specification file or remote resource.

A spec file for Zaqar v1.0 is provided in the distribution (see
F<share/marconi.spec.json>).

=head2 token

(read-only string with default predicate)

The token is automatically set when calling C<rackspace_authenticate>
successfully.  Once set, it will be sent in the "X-Auth-Token" header
with each query.

Rackspace invalidates the token after 24h, at which point all the
queries will start returning "401 Unauthorized".  Consider using
C<do_request> to manage this for you.

=head2 wants_auth

(read-only boolean, defaults to false)

If this attribute is set to true, you are indicating that the endpoint
needs authentication.  This means that when a request wrapped with
C<do_request> fails with "401 Unauthorized", the client will try
(re-)authenticating with C<rackspace_authenticate>, using the values
in C<rackspace_keystone_endpoint>, C<rackspace_username> and
C<rackspace_api_key>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 DELEGATED METHODS

All methods listed in L<the API
docs|https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Marconi/specs/api/v1> are
implemented by the SPORE client.  When a body is required, you must
provide it via the C<payload> parameter.

See the F<share/marconi.spore.json> file for the list of methods and
their parameters.

All those methods can be called with an instance of
L<WebService::Zaqar> as invocant; they will be delegated to the SPORE
client.

Unlike "regular" SPORE-based clients, you may use the special
C<__url__> parameter to provide an already-built URL directly.  This
is helpful when trying to follow links provided by the API itself.
E.g. when you make a claim on a queue, the server does not return the
claim and message IDs; instead it returns URLs to the claim and
messages, which you are then supposed to call if you want to release
or update the claim, delete a message, etc.

  my $response = $client->claim_messages(queue_name => 'potato');
  my $claim_href = $response->header('Location');
  $client->release_claim(__url__ => $claim_href);

=head2 do_request

  my $response = $client->do_request(sub { $client->list_queues(limit => 20) },
                                     { retries => 2 },
                                     @etc);

This method can be used to manage token generation.  The first
argument should be a coderef; it will be executing within a C<try { }>
statement.  If the coderef throws a blessed exception of class
L<Net::HTTP::Spore::Response> (or a subclass thereof), that response's
status is "401 Unauthorized", and C<wants_auth> was set to a true
value, C<rackspace_authenticate> will be called and the coderef will
be retried.

If the exception has another status code, it will be rethrown as-is,
without retrying.  This generally leads to a somewhat cryptic "HTTP
response: 403" exception, since L<Net::HTTP::Spore::Response> objects
stringify to their status code.  If the status code was 599 (internal
exception), the response's error message will be thrown instead.

If the exception is not a L<Net::HTTP::Spore::Response> instance at
all, it will be rethrown directly.

Otherwise, the coderef's return value is returned.

The second argument is a hashref of options.  Currently only "retries"
is implemented:

=over 4

=item if "retries" is undefined or not provided, C<do_request> will
retry indefinitely until successful

=item if "retries" is 0, C<do_request> will not retry

=item if "retries" is any other integer, C<do_request> will retry up
to that many times.

=back

The coderef will be called with the original invocant of C<do_request>
and the rest of the arguments of C<do_request> as parameters.

=head2 rackspace_authenticate

  my $token = $client->rackspace_authenticate('https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/tokens',
                                              $rackspace_account,
                                              $rackspace_key);

Sends an HTTP request to a L<Cloud
Identity|http://docs.rackspace.com/queues/api/v1.0/cq-gettingstarted/content/Generating_Auth_Token.html>
endpoint (or compatible) and sets the token received.

See also L</token>.

=head1 SPORE MIDDLEWARES ENABLED

The following modifications are applied to requests before they are
made, in order:

=over 4

=item serializing the body to JSON

=item setting the C<X-Auth-Token> header to the authentication token,
if available

=item setting the C<Date> header to the current date in RFC 1123
format

=item setting the C<Client-ID> header to the value of the
C<client_uuid> attribute

=item if the C<__url__> parameter is provided to the method call,
replace the request path and querystring params with its value

=back

The following modifications are applied to responses before they are
returned, in order:

=over 4

=item deserializing the body from JSON, except for 401 and 403
responses, which are likely to come from Keystone instead and are
plain text.

=back
